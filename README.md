Welcome to the **JS Drum Kit**!  
A fun and interactive drum kit built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## 🛠️ How It Works

- **HTML** lays out the drum pads and links the audio files.
- **CSS** styles the pads, background, and animations for key presses.
- **JavaScript** listens for keyboard events, plays the corresponding drum sound, and triggers pad animations.

### Main Files

- `index.html` — Main page structure and audio elements.
- `style.css` — Stylish, animated drum pads and background.
- `script.js` — Keyboard event listeners and sound logic.

## 🎹 Usage

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Press `A`, `S`, `D`, `F`, `G`, `H`, `J`, `K`, `L` keys to play different sounds!
